# timeFA

#### Installation

There is an `install_github` function to install R packages hosted on GitHub in the **devtools** package.

For now, our R package is hosted on GitHub. So you can install it by:
```R
install_github("ZeBang/timeFA")
```
Remark: You have to install package "devtools" first if you haven't.
