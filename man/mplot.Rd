\title{Plot Matrix-Valued Time Series}
\usage{
mplot(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{xx}{\eqn{T \times d_1 \times d_2} matrix-valued time series. Note that the number of mode is 3, where the first mode is time.}
}
\description{
Plot matrix-valued time series, can be also used to plot tensor-valued time series by given mode.
}
\examples{
dim <- c(3,3,3)
xx <- tenAR.sim(t=500, dim, R=2, P=1, rho=0.5, cov='iid')
mplot(xx[,,1])
}
